The Bioinformatics of Genomics course is designed to be a fully guided course for baseline genomics analyses. The course will begin with basic introductions to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, and compute resources. Next it will delve into language specific training, and lastly review individual NGS analysis workflows. Each section will include at minimum a lecture, but will also have interactive Jupyter Notebooks for applicable code.
